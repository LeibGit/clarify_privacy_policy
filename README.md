# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 01/07/2026

This Chrome extension is designed to assist users while reading programming documentation by providing contextual explanations.

## Data Collection

This extension does not collect, store, or sell personal user data.

## Page Content Access

The extension temporarily accesses text from the currently active webpage **only when the user explicitly activates the extension**. This content is used solely to generate contextual explanations and is not retained after processing.

## Storage

Any data stored by the extension is limited to local user preferences and temporary session context. This data remains on the user’s device and is not transmitted for tracking or analytics purposes.

## Third-Party Services

If the extension communicates with external services (such as an AI API), only the user-requested text is transmitted for processing. No personal information is shared beyond what the user chooses to provide through interaction with the extension.

## Data Security

No user data is sold, shared, or used for advertising.

## Changes

This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes to the extension’s functionality.
